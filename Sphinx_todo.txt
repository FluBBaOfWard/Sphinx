Bandai WonderSwan/Sphinx To do
------------------------------

	Add support for cart-io waitstates.
	Handle double buffered tile maps better, see Hataraku Chocobo.
	Fix HyperVoice stereo handling.
	Palette change per line?
	Sound frequency updates are not working as on HW (writing to frequency reg).
	Sound rendering affects timing of sweep and noise.
	Ch4 noise/LFSR is not clear how/when it's clocked.
	Handle Contrast High/Low for WSC, change Y every other frame.
	Check sprite start & sprite count.
