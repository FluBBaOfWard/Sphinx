Bandai WonderSwan/Sphinx To do
------------------------------

	Use scrollbuffer for tilemap settings, just add map number as new Y*0x100 and use 32*64 tilemap on NDS/GBA.
		Mask Y value correctly against NDS/GBA tilemap.
	Add check for dirty tiles in tilemap renderer.
	Sprite DMA should really be at line 142. Need to update NDS sprites before that.
	Check sprite start & sprite count.
	Handle LCD on/off.
	Fix icons.
	Fix noise:
		Different taps.
		Frequency.
	Add sweep to sound.
	Add voice to ch 2.
	Add Hyper Voice.
	Only enable appropriate registers on the different versions of the SOC.
